### Why not get these things from other projects?
I want to be less of a [Duct von Tape](https://wiki.osdev.org/Duct_von_Tape), so I'm actually trying to learn something instead of gluing together stuff and bringing duct tape to the brink of extinction. Still, please help.
## Building
```bash
./build.sh # I guess, hell, idk
```
